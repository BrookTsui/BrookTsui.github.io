# Notes
 
1. [String Theory and CFT](../files/stringtheory.pdf) [Ch]

The string part covers mainly the front half of David Tong's lecture, and the CFT part comes from several sources. 

2. [T-Duality](../files/Tduality.pdf) [En]

The final report of the class about string theory. 

3. Quantum Electron Dynamics [En]

I like to teach since it always inspires me a lot. This note is writen for teaching one of my roommates about QED for his study on quantum optics.

4. [Majorana Fermions](../files/majorana.pdf) [En]

I was fascinated by this interesting object, but I failed to understand its meaning the first time I came to it. Years later, when I began to study neutrino physics, it appears again and I tried to study it. 

5. Neutrino Mass [En]

I introduced basic electroweak theory, explained the zero-neutrino-mass requirement in SM, and discuss some some mass models, including the Seesaw mechanism.

# Report
1. [Hawking Emission](../files/hawkingppt.pdf) [En]

This is the report I gave in the collaboration with Prof. Tsai of Univ. of Notre Dame. I briefly discussed the curved-spacetime QFT, the calculation of the Hawking emission rate, and some perspectives on the subject.  

2. [PEPV](../files/pepv.pdf) [En], [Exotic Transition](../files/exotic%20transition.pdf) [En]

The first report I made to the overseas collaborators is on my theoretical work about the non-commutative spacetime. I showed the developed model in the second one, and discussed the experiments for detection.

# Miscellanous Thoughts 
1. [GUP, the Generalized Uncertainty Principle](../files/GUP.pdf) [En]

This is a short note about my idea for GUP. When I was scanning ArXiv, some related articles attracted my attention, and after researching I found the way people treat it is not satisfying. Therefore I tried to give my solution, and discussed it with Prof. Tsai. 

However, GUP itself has many conceptual issues, like negative entropy, so I did not hurry to elaborate on it. When the relative subject become matured, maybe I would heed it again.  

In hindsight, the Prof. Yang's argument about the negative temperature behavior in BH spacetime possibly originates from the GUP.
