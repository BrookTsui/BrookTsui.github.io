This is my archive where one can find all my notes and haphazard writings. 

# A Paper A Day
I read [a story](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/this-scientist-read-research-academic-paper-every-day-what-she-learned) from a [blog](https://hongtaoh.com/en/apad/). 

It's must be benefitial to read new papers and log thoughts everyday. Surely I browser ArXiv, but not that frequent. Now I have subscribed it, maybe I could read more. 

Here is the [link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Asze0FhXxWSmlnvuRSnhqXHslCPZ?e=tMZpUn) to my OneNote of APAD. It starts since Oct. 25, 2022.

# Notes
 
1. [Black Hole Thermodynamics, Negative Temperature](../files/BH-T.pdf) [Ch]

This is the PDF version of my report about black hole thermodynamics and negative temperature. A brief introduction to the topic covering the basic BH thermodynamics, the derivation of Hawking temperature, the discussion of negative temperature. 

2. [String Theory and CFT](../files/stringtheory.pdf) [Ch]

The string part covers mainly the front half of David Tong's lecture, and the CFT part comes from several sources. 

3. [T-Duality](../files/Tduality.pdf) [En]

The final report of the class about string theory. 

4. Quantum Electron Dynamics [En]

I lavish to teach others since it also benefits me a lot. This note writen when I was teaching one of my roommates about QED for his study on quantum optics.

5. [Majorana Fermions](../files/majorana.pdf) [En]

I was fascinated by this interesting object, but I failed to understand its meaning the first time I came to it. Years later, when I began to study neutrino physics, it appears again and I tried to study it. 

6. Neutrino Mass [En]

I introduced basic electroweak theory, explained the zero-neutrino-mass requirement in SM, and discuss some some mass models, including the Seesaw mechanism.

# Report
1. [Hawking Emission](../files/hawkingppt.pdf) [En]

This is the report I gave in the collaboration with Prof. Tsai of Univ. of Notre Dame. I briefly discussed the curved-spacetime QFT, the calculation of the Hawking emission rate, and some perspectives on the subject.  

2. [PEPV](../files/pepv.pdf) [En]

This is the report I made to the professors from Turkey on my theoretical work in the PEPV. Some ideas were unclear then, and I developed them later on. The final form is in the paper. 

3. [Exotic Transition](../files/exotic%20transition.pdf) [En]

The continuation of the last report. I corrected my calculation, and proved some theorems, re-designed and elaborated on another experiment to test the model.

# Miscellanous Thoughts 
1. [GUP, the Generalized Uncertainty Principle](../files/GUP.pdf) [En]

This is a short note about my idea for GUP. When I was scanning ArXiv, some related articles attracted my attention, and after researching I found the way people treat it is not satisfying. Therefore I tried to give my solution, and discussed it with Prof. Tsai. 

However, GUP itself has many conceptual issues, like negative entropy, so I did not hurry to elaborate on it. When the relative subject become matured, maybe I would heed it again.  

In hindsight, the Prof. Yang's argument about the negative temperature behavior in BH spacetime possibly originates from the GUP.
