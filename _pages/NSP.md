It is an answer, partly, for one of my long-nagging questions since learning QM: What will happen if we alter the (anti-)commutators? With the complex number, the comparatively perfect number field, $\pm 1$ is nothing but two incidences, and the more general coefficients between operators is $ab+e^{i \theta} ba=0$. What will result from it? 

One day, my friend, a future experimentalist, showed me their current work relative to it, and said they need a theory guy. Then I said yes.

The altered relation in the model considered comes from replacing the regular product $\cdot$ with the Moyal produt $\star$, which is defined by Drinfel'd twist, turning $\pm1 \rightarrow \pm e^{i \chi f(E, J)}$, where $\chi$ is the model parameter, E and J are energy and angular momentum, respectively. It slightly differs from the conventional $\theta$-Poincare model and is more consistent with bound states. 

Their motivation lies in the flaw of the experimental data used by the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1185), which mainly discusses two electron conditions. They were curious if it can be extrapolated into many-body condition. 

More fancy process with the three electrons cramped in 1S as the final state. However, this is beyond the priginal paper, which has only constructed a two-body relationship. Hence my work. 

I first studied the necessary mathematical setting - the Hopf algebra and the Drinfel'd twist, and made a short report to them. After poring the model, I found a way of imposing it on many-body systems, which has proved naive. Days later, after further studying, I understood the twist-trick they used and posited a possibly right extrapolation into any-body systems. The scheme adopted is to twist the permutation algebra and construct a twisted Fock space out of Hilbert space. 

At the same time, I found some secret mistakes in the phase structure made by others. The theory would be comparatively neat after correcting. And based on this, I have shown that there will not be identical fermionic states even in the non-commutative spacetime, and therefore the final states they considered would be more exotic, that is, it exists in terms of a bosonic state. The non-zero overlap of an initial fermionic state to a final bosonic state is the unique prediction of non-commutative spacetime. 

Other than the exotic transition in atoms, we also considered its possible appearance in the nucleus, where one can make a much more precise detection. After research, I rejected this plan since the shell model is not precise, and the processes of nuclear have yet to be clarified. The argument would thus be convoluted. 

The extremely small $\chi$ suppresses the exotic transition that is experimentally interesting. To bound its value from experiments, Choosing the appropriate channel and atoms is necessary. We are not satisfied with this part of the original paper and have tried to posit a more consistent plan and explanation. 

The paper is in writing, and we hope to publish it at the end of the year.
