It is an answer, partly, for one of my long-nagging questions since learning QM: What will happen if we alter the (anti-)commutators? With the complex number, the comparatively perfect number field, $\pm 1$ is nothing but two incidences, and the more general coefficients between operators are $ab+e^{i \theta} ba=0$. What will result from it? 

One day, my friend, a future experimentalist, showed me their current work relative to it and said they need a theory guy. Then I said yes.

The altered relation in the model considered comes from replacing the regular product $\cdot$ with the Moyal product $\star$ defined by the Drinfel'd twist, turning $\pm1 \rightarrow \pm e^{i \chi f(E, J)}$, where $\chi$ is the model parameter, E and J are energy and angular momentum, respectively. It amounts to timing new state-dependent phases. slightly differs from the conventional $\theta$-Poincare model and is more consistent with bound states. 

Their motivation lies in the flaw of the experimental data used by the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1185), which solely discusses the condition of two electrons. They were also concerned about the correctness of the theoretical calculation.

Based on this, I studied the necessary mathematical setting - the twisted Hopf algebra, which is a general aspect of the quantum group. By comparing the model and the mathematical frame, I realized we can go beyond the proposal of the original paper, and generalize the model into many-body systems. 

It requires proving the validity of a mathematical construction in twisted cases, which is barely discussed in the literature. Initially, I constructed two types of extrapolation and ruled out one in a physical sense. However, I was not confident about the mathematical trick applied, so I came to prof. Lu, a mathematician specialized in the quantum group. We checked together several aspects of it, including co-associativity and co-unit, and were convinced it is right. I am appreciative of his generosity. 

I made a short report to collaborators. With the generalized model, we then decide to focus on a rather exotic atomic transition with three electrons cramped in 1S, which is impossible in SM. The probability roots in the new phase and is proportional to $\chi$, whose extreme smallness will suppress such transition. 

Meanwhile, I began to redevelop the formalism in my style because I was not satisfied with the paper's treatment. After several attempts, the permutation algebra, out of the permutation group, seems appropriate. Twisting it yields twisted Fock space out of Hilbert space.  

By digging deep into the model, I also found a secret mistake in the phase structure made by previous works. They seem to incorrectly treat the phase difference as the absolute phase multiplying in the front of states. It has little effect on the numerical result. Nonetheless, only after the correction, it is consistent with QFT. 

Furthermore, I have shown that the Pauli Exclusion Principle still holds in noncommutative spacetime. However, we should consider the phase factors and states simultaneously. This argument helps to clarify some misunderstandings or confusion among experimentalists. 

Besides atoms, we also considered the possibility of detection in nuclei, where experiments are more precise. After conferring, I vetoed the plan given the current lack of knowledge about the transitions in nuclei and the ambiguity in the strictness of the shell model, which both will make the discussion convoluted.

When theoretical dust settles, experimentalists start to find data and set the upper bound of $\chi$. The recent progress limits its value under $10^{-40}$. 

Now, the paper is in writing, and the theoretical part I am responsible for is done. We anticipate publishing on *Phy. Rev. Lett.* at the end of the year.
