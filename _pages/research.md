## 1. Black Hole Thermodynamics
- Institution: Sichuan University, China
- Mentor: Haitang Yang, Peng Wang
- Data: Dec. 2020- Jun. 2021

Our original argument is that if one considers the horizon radius as the maximum position uncertainty of the singularity, there must be a minimum energy uncertainty $\Delta E$. However, the radius of the horizon is generally proportional to the energy. One thus may think there is a limit of the black hole energy as $E+\Delta E$. The upper bound of energy usually implies the possibility of negative temperature, hence the project. 

After studying BH physics and quantum mechanics, I realized it was wrong eventually. There is no upper limit of black holes, except for the ineffable Planck unit. That the uncertainty virtually leads to the Hawking radiation instead of the negative temperature is the conclusion. 

But we still tried to probe the possibility of negative temperature. In this period, I studied the energy-bounded S. H. O.s as the prototype and posited a naive formula about integral partition. 

Also, since the temperature is defined as $\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}$, it is straightforward to posit a process with $\Delta S>0$ but $\Delta E<0$ or vice versa. We did consider the negative-mass objects or white holes, but I soon gave up since they are both radical. 

Meanwhile, I also learned the phase transition and the chaotic behavior of BHs for interest and have derived the Lyapunov exponent for the RN-AdS BH. 

Nonetheless, the pandemic began to rage. Quarantined at home without enough communication with the mentor, seeing the program as grim, I eventually decided to quit it. 

When logging this period, I came to the paper written by T. Jacobson *et al*  on the negative temperature, in which they considered the BHs in the casual diamonds with the appearance of an upper energy bound. 

In hindsight, I have learned a lot from this subject, which has led me into the palace of theoretical physics. I appreciate of all of it in terms of this. However, this is also my naive 

The true value of a person is determined, first of all, by the extent to which and in what sense he is liberated from the self.

## 3. Axion-like Massive Scalars from Hawking Emission of Primordial Black Holes
- Location: University of Notre Dame, USA
- Mentor: Yushin Tsai
- Data: July 2022 - Now

        \item {I did the background research on the topic and have discussed the possible way of calculating the Hawking radiation.}
        \item {During this period, I happen to find a research field called GUP, the generalized uncertainty principle and posited my generalization, which could yield some results more naturally. I collated it into a short paper and shared it with Prof. Tsai, but since it seems hard to explain some by-products, we finally did not try to elaborate on it. }
        \item {After studying the works done by Page, Unruh, and others, we have been now trying to reproduce the Hawking radiation spectra for heavy massive scalar particles. }
         \end{cvitems}
