## 1. Black Hole Thermodynamics
- Institution: Sichuan University, China
- Mentor: Haitang Yang, Peng Wang
- Data: Dec. 2020- Jun. 2021

After taking, 

Under the instruction of Prof. HaiTang Yang, I learned the curved spacetime QFT and classical black hole thermodynamics and made a Latex note for the latter.}
        \item {In the investigation, I was intrigued by the negative temperature physics and studied some related topics. Also, to describe the negative T behavior that potentially appears in energy-restricted S.H.O., I posited an integer partition formula with good accuracy. And found some papers discussing such negative T condition for black holes.}
        \item {Under the instruction of Prof. Peng Wang, I studied the chaos behavior of black holes, especially the reaction of null and time-like geodesics of a point-like particle under the phase transition, we found the chaos of these geodesics, which means their free energies undergo a discontinuous change, meanwhile the Lyapunov exponent varies.}
        \item {Then investigated the behavior of a classical string in RN-Ads spacetime, and found that this string will oscillate when it approaches the black hole, and its Lyapunov exponent changes completely discontinuously.}
        \item {Due to my health issue, I quit the group in Jun. 2021, and the paper about the chaos was published on JHEP on 2022.}

## 2. Non-cummutative Spacetime and Pauli Exclusion Principle Violation(PEPV)
- Institution: Sichuan University, China
- Mentor: Xingde Lin
- Data: Apr. 2022 - Now

      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {I did the background research about the Pauli Exclusion Principle Violation (PEPV) due to the non-commutative spacetime and have been responsible for the theoretical part.}
        \item {Learned some mathematics, including the Hopf algebra, and based on this, I have developed the formalism of the model proposed by Balachandran $\textit{et al}$ to many-body systems.}
        \item {Proved some theorems, including the corrected Pauli principle-like theorem, and corrected some mistakes made by others.}
        \item {Help to design the experiments.}
        \item {In June, I made a report about some parts of my work to professors from Turkey.}
        \item {The Paper is in writing now. We anticipate publishing it at the end of the year.}
      \end{cvitems}

## 3. Axion-like Massive Scalars from Hawking Emission of Primordial Black Holes
- Location: University of Notre Dame, USA
- Mentor: Yushin Tsai
- Data: July 2022 - Now

        \item {I did the background research on the topic and have discussed the possible way of calculating the Hawking radiation.}
        \item {During this period, I happen to find a research field called GUP, the generalized uncertainty principle and posited my generalization, which could yield some results more naturally. I collated it into a short paper and shared it with Prof. Tsai, but since it seems hard to explain some by-products, we finally did not try to elaborate on it. }
        \item {After studying the works done by Page, Unruh, and others, we have been now trying to reproduce the Hawking radiation spectra for heavy massive scalar particles. }
         \end{cvitems}

## 4. Neutrino Mass Problem and Beyond
- Institution: Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
- Mentor: Jianghao Yu
- Data: Aug. 2022 - Now

\item {I have learned the electroweak theory, the neutrino mass model, including the Seesaw mechanism, and neutrino oscillation processes, including the MSW effect and collective oscillation, from the pendulum aspect and Boltzmann equation aspect.}
        \item {Studied the solar neutrino problem, the formation of neutron stars and the role neutrinos play in it.}
        \item {We then plan to study the unknown interactions of neutrinos.}
      \end{cvitems}
