Our original argument is that if one considers the horizon radius $r$ as the position uncertainty of the singularity, there must be an energy uncertainty $\Delta E\sim \frac{1}{r}$, hence $E \Delta E\sim 1$ given $E\sim r$. One thus may consider the BH energy spectra as a band rather than a line. The appearance of the upper bound usually implies the possibility of negative temperature, hence the project. 

After studying BH physics and quantum mechanics, I realized it was wrong eventually. The point is that $r$ is actually the maximum position uncertainty, and then $\Delta E$ is the minimum uncertainty. The energy spectra are exactly the complement of the so-called band. No upper bound. 

But still, I decided to continue the research because I found it a fascinating thermodynamical concept. We generally believe that $\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}>0$ is true for BHs, but out of the pure formal symmetry, there is no reason to not discuss the opposite. 

---

Firstly, I studied the regular negative temperature systems, including the population inversion in Laser and nuclear-spin systems. Their common feature, the symmetrical configuration of the highest energy and the lowest energy, led me to propose a general and simplified model for negative temperature. 

It is the energy-bounded and number-limited quantum S. H. O. For example, N oscillators huddling in $E=0$ state or $E=E_{max}$ state both have zero entropy, and then a smooth transition must yield a fraction with $\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}<0$. 

Quantifying the entropy requires the restricted integer partition function. I independently proved a recurrence relation. After communicating with a friend studying mathematics, I found it's a rather special case that has been studied previously. With his help, I learned a lot of number theory then and modified an equation from the [paper](../files/PN.pdf) which we adopted later on. 

---

Then I began to connect it with BHs. During this period, I tried four ways: 

1. I followed the work of [Yuxiao Liu and Shaowen Wei](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.071103) on counting BH microstates via Ruppener geometry, discussing the entropy in the scheme of BH molecules. However, it is virtually irrelevant to our proposal and mainly restricted to the Van der Waals analogy. 
In this period, I came to the subject called BH phase transition and chaos. For interest, I discussed the phase space of RN-AdS BH, calculated the Lyapunov exponent by MMA, and studied the reaction of null and time-like geodesics of a point-like particle and classical string under the Large/Small BH phase transition. The free energies indeed undergo a discontinuous change. 

2. After the first attempt, I realized we should go beyond the static BHs since negative T systems are out of equilibrium, and then found [M. Park's paper](../files/parkexoticbtz.pdf) about the negative T appearing in exotic-BTZ black holes. I reproduced the result. But in the discussion with the mentor, we felt some arguments were skeptical. Therefore I did not follow the work. 

3. I considered the negative-entropy objects and white holes (WH), which seem promising for the subject. I independently proved that for WHs the temperature should be negative and entropy should be positive by considering WHs as the time-reversed BHs. However, I then found [Volovik](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10954) has published a series of papers for this project. Then it aborted. 

4. Meanwhile, I began to consider the possibility of mapping a negative T quantum system on the boundary to the bulk by AdS/CFT. It requires many mathematical and physical preliminaries, but the mentor and I both like it, so I bought many relevant books for preparation.

However, the pandemic began to rage. Quarantined at home without enough communication with the mentor, seeing the program as grim, and a terrible thing happened to inflict upon one of my dearest family members, I eventually decided to quit the group. 

Months later, I concluded all my work in a [report](../files/BH-T.pdf) and submitted it to the National Undergraduate Innovation Program and won the University Award. 

When logging this period, I came to the [paper](../files/jacobson-T.pdf) written by T. Jacobson *et al*  on the negative temperature, in which they considered the BHs in the casual diamonds with the appearance of upper energy bound. Another interesting possibility I never thought of before. 

In hindsight, I have learned a lot from this subject, which has led me into the palace of theoretical physics. I appreciate all of it in terms of this. However, this has also exposed my problems like being afraid to confer with the mentor, lacking the ability of information retrieving that I should find Volovik's or Jacobson's paper earlier, and giving up easily. 

Now, after a whole year, I believe I have overcome them. But still, hope this unsuccessful starting could be my toll ticking once I am on the verge of relapsing.

# 2. Noncummutative Spacetime Phenomenology

It is a part of the conclusion for one of my long-lagging questions since I was learning QM, what will happen if we alter the (anti-)commutators? From the aspect of the comparatively perfect number field, complex number, $\pm1$ is nothing but two incidences, and the more general relation between operators shall be $ab+e^{i \theta} ba=0$. What will result from it? 

One day, my friend showed me their current work relative to it, and they needed a theory guy since they are experimentalists. Then I said yes. 

The altered relation comes from the non-commutativity of spacetime and  $\pm1 \rightarrow e^{i \chi f(E, J)}$, where $\chi$ is the model parameter, E and J are energy and angular momentum, respectively. It slightly differs from the conventional $\theta$-Poincare model and is more consistent with bound states. 

Their motivation lies in the flaw of the experimental data of the [paper](../files/balachandran.pdf) they followed. They were also curious about a more fancy process with the three electrons cramped in 1S as the final state. However, this is beyond the priginal paper, which has only constructed a two-body relationship. Hence my work. 

I first studied the necessary mathematical setting - the Hopf algebra and the Drinfel'd twist, and made a short report to them. After poring the model, I found a way of imposing it on many-body systems, which has proved naive. Days later, after further studying, I understood the twist-trick they used and posited a possibly right extrapolation into any-body systems. The scheme adopted is to twist the permutation algebra and construct a twisted Fock space out of Hilbert space. 

At the same time, I found some secret mistakes in the phase structure made by others. The theory would be comparatively neat after correcting. And based on this, I have shown that there will not be identical fermionic states even in the non-commutative spacetime, and therefore the final states they considered would be more exotic, that is, it exists in terms of a bosonic state. The non-zero overlap of an initial fermionic state to a final bosonic state is the unique prediction of non-commutative spacetime. 

Other than the exotic transition in atoms, we also considered its possible appearance in the nucleus, where one can make a much more precise detection. After research, I rejected this plan since the shell model is not precise, and the processes of nuclear have yet to be clarified. The argument would thus be convoluted. 

The extremely small $\chi$ suppresses the exotic transition that is experimentally interesting. To bound its value from experiments, Choosing the appropriate channel and atoms is necessary. We are not satisfied with this part of the original paper and have tried to posit a more consistent plan and explanation. 

The paper is in writing, and we hope to publish it at the end of the year.

# 3. Bound on Primordial Black Holes Being DM

This is curcuitous story. 

At the beginning of March 2022, I sent an email to Prof. Tsai asking if he intended to enroll a student for the summer research. He rejected it since there had already been four students in his lab. But he was welcome for my physical questions. And we, therefore, have kept in touch. 

Initially, I just tried to follow [his work about the unitary bound](../files/ubound.pdf), which I found interesting since I used to take it as granted. Meanwhile, I have consulted him many times the questions about the electroweak theory. During this period, I also sent him my idea about the GUP, although we did not elaborate on it since there are some peculiar traits hard to justify. 

The question-and-answer exchange lasted for several months, and the collaboration began in July. 

The energy of photons coming from the decay of scalars, like axions, emitted from PBHs lies in the scope of detection of current experiments, and in this way we hope to bound the aboundance of PBHs, hence the bound on the possibility of the being DM. The crux is the calculation of the massive scalars spectra of PBHs for the whole energy-scale, which is oblivious in the traditional context of particle physics. There are some analytical works for the low-energy limit; the conventional code, [BlackHawk](https://blackhawk.hepforge.org/), for producing Hawking radiation is designated for massless particles; and the rare complete works showing the complete spcetra are scattered miscallaneously in several areas on different aspects with various notions. 

We hope to not only to set the bound on PBHs but also make a systematic and comprehensive work integrating these, offering the particle physics shpere a handy reference. 

First, the Hawking emission, which I have learned a lot in the first research but overlooked the detailed calculation of the rate. (I usually feel confused about the Page curve, wondering how to evaluate the vaporating time.)

I first read two papers by [Unruh](../files/Unruh.pdf) and [Page](../files/Page.pdf) for a basic picture. Their analytical derivation is both on the low-energy scale. Although Unruh discussed the massive scalars in Schwarzschild spacetime, but he did not plot the whole diagram covering the region of interest. 

After research, I found a [paper](../files/carolina.pdf) talking about the complete spectra of massive scalars in RN BHs, which then became our basis of studying. 

To develop a through understanding of the subject, I have read [Hawking's original paper](../files/Haw75.pdf) and [Guth's famous note](../files/Guth76.pdf). They corrected my naive understanding about Hawking radiation that it originates merely from the coordinate transformation and Bogoliubov transformation. 

All I have learned was included in the [report](../files/hawkingppt.pdf) I gave to Prof. Tsai and the postdoc Tao in the meeting. 

When the prepartion was done, I began the calculation by numerical methods. The basic method is the partial wave decomposition and equivalent-potential trick. This has been a challanging and interesting task since I am not proficient at MMA or other numerical tools. In the half month, I have read through a textbook about MMA. Eventually, by NDSolve with the help of the document, the circuitous road leads me to the right spectra.

To be continued.

As I said, the neutrino physics is a not-to-miss subject, where theories and experiments parade abreast. So I came to Prof. Yu. 

I have learned the electroweak theory, the neutrino mass model, including the Seesaw mechanism, and neutrino oscillation processes, including the MSW effect and collective oscillation, from the pendulum aspect and Boltzmann equation aspect.

Firsly, I simulated the solar neutrino evolution,
