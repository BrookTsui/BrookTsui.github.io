## 1. Black Hole Thermodynamics
- Institution: Sichuan University, China
- Mentor: Haitang Yang, Peng Wang
- Date: Dec. 2020 - Jun. 2021

Our original argument is that if one considers the horizon radius as the maximum position uncertainty of the singularity, there must be a minimum energy uncertainty $\Delta E$. However, the radius of the horizon is generally proportional to the energy. One thus may think there is a limit of the black hole energy as $E+\Delta E$. The upper bound of energy usually implies the possibility of negative temperature, hence the project. 

After studying BH physics and quantum mechanics, I realized it was wrong eventually. There is no natural upper limit of black holes, except for the ineffable Planck unit. That the uncertainty virtually leads to the Hawking radiation instead of the negative temperature is the conclusion. 

But we still tried to probe the possibility of negative temperature. During this period, I studied the energy-bounded S. H. O. as the prototype for which the entropy equals the number of ways of diving the energy with an upper limit for each oscillator. I have searched many ways of restricted integral partition and included the one fitting our needs best in the report. 

Also, since the temperature is defined as $\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}$, it is straightforward to posit a process with $\Delta S>0$ but $\Delta E<0$ or vice versa. We did consider the negative-mass objects or white holes, but I soon gave up since they are both radical. In the later research, I have found [M. Park's paper](../files/parkexoticbtz.pdf) about the negative temperature appearing in exotic-BTZ black holes, of which the discussion I remained skeptical. Therefore we included it in our report but did not follow his work.  

Meanwhile, I learned the phase transition and the chaotic behavior of BHs for interest and have derived the Lyapunov exponent for the RN-AdS BH. 

Nonetheless, the pandemic began to rage. Quarantined at home without enough communication with the mentor, seeing the program as grim, I eventually decided to quit it and packaged all the work I had done in a [report](../files/BH-T.pdf).

When logging this period, I came to the [paper](../files/jacobson-T.pdf) written by T. Jacobson *et al*  on the negative temperature, in which they considered the BHs in the casual diamonds with the appearance of an upper energy bound. 

In hindsight, I have learned a lot from this subject, which has led me into the palace of theoretical physics. I appreciate all of it in terms of this. However, this has also exposed my problems then, like being afraid to confer with the mentor when I found he was wrong, lacking the ability to information retrieving that I should find the Jacobson's paper, and giving up easily and attributing all blame to the pandemic. The narrow knowledge of general relativity that only does the Schwarzschild BH come to me when think BHs also made me oblivious of a broad picture, including the causal structure, *etc.*

I hope this not successful starting could be my toll ticking once I am on the verge of relapsing.

## 2. Non-cummutative Spacetime and Pauli Exclusion Principle Violation(PEPV)
- Institution: Sichuan University, China
- Mentor: Xingde Lin
- Date: Apr. 2022 - Now

It is a part of the conclusion for one of my long-lagging questions since I was learning QM, what will happen if we alter the (anti-)commutators? From the aspect of the comparatively perfect number field, complex number, $\pm1$ is nothing but two incidences, and the more general relation between operators shall be $ab+e^{i \theta} ba=0$. What will result from it? 

One day, my friend showed me their current work relative to it, and they needed a theory guy since they are experimentalists. Then I said yes. 

The altered relation comes from the non-commutativity of spacetime and  $\pm1 \rightarrow e^{i \chi f(E, J)}$, where $\chi$ is the model parameter, E and J are energy and angular momentum, respectively. It slightly differs from the conventional $\theta$-Poincare model and is more consistent with bound states. 

Their motivation lies in the flaw of the experimental data of the [paper](../files/balachandran.pdf) they followed. They were also curious about a more fancy process with the three electrons cramped in 1S as the final state. However, this is beyond the priginal paper, which has only constructed a two-body relationship. Hence my work. 

I first studied the necessary mathematical setting - the Hopf algebra and the Drinfel'd twist, and made a short report to them. After poring the model, I found a way of imposing it on many-body systems, which has proved naive. Days later, after further studying, I understood the twist-trick they used and posited a possibly right extrapolation into any-body systems. The scheme adopted is to twist the permutation algebra and construct a twisted Fock space out of Hilbert space. 

At the same time, I found some secret mistakes in the phase structure made by others. The theory would be comparatively neat after correcting. And based on this, I have shown that there will not be identical fermionic states even in the non-commutative spacetime, and therefore the final states they considered would be more exotic, that is, it exists in terms of a bosonic state. The non-zero overlap of an initial fermionic state to a final bosonic state is the unique prediction of non-commutative spacetime. 

Other than the exotic transition in atoms, we also considered its possible appearance in the nucleus, where one can make a much more precise detection. After research, I rejected this plan since the shell model is not precise, and the processes of nuclear have yet to be clarified. The argument would thus be convoluted. 

The extremely small $\chi$ suppresses the exotic transition that is experimentally interesting. To bound its value from experiments, Choosing the appropriate channel and atoms is necessary. We are not satisfied with this part of the original paper and have tried to posit a more consistent plan and explanation. 

The paper is in writing, and we hope to publish it at the end of the year.

## 3. Axion-like Massive Scalars from Hawking Emission of Primordial Black Holes
- Location: University of Notre Dame, USA
- Mentor: Yushin Tsai
- Date: July 2022 - Now

This is curcuitous story. 

At the beginning of March, 2022, I sent an email to Prof. Tsai asking if he wish to enroll a student for the summer research. He rejected since there had already been 4 students in his lab, but was welcome for my physical questions. And we therefore have keep in communication. 

At the very beginning, I just tried to follow his works that I interest in, about the unitary bound and 



        \item {I did the background research on the topic and have discussed the possible way of calculating the Hawking radiation.}
        \item {During this period, I happen to find a research field called GUP, the generalized uncertainty principle and posited my generalization, which could yield some results more naturally. I collated it into a short paper and shared it with Prof. Tsai, but since it seems hard to explain some by-products, we finally did not try to elaborate on it. }
        \item {After studying the works done by Page, Unruh, and others, we have been now trying to reproduce the Hawking radiation spectra for heavy massive scalar particles. }
