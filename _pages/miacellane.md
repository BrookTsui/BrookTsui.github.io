For me, so many aspects in my life worth to log, but the most memorable joyous time is the two years among the friends of the drama club. We recite, rehersal, and performe. I have passed the most lighthearted age. It howled, and darted away.

In the picture of x<0, y>0 quadrant, we mimiced a bus accidence, and I was the driver. I thumbed up toward the camera when another guy "died" :)

In x<0, y<0, we were gonna perform an original drama about an historical figure, and I was a student. 
In x>0, y<0, I was a servant in the play *the chameleon* writen by Chekhov.

My knights of heart are H. Hesse, W. Whitman, and R. Feynman. I also admire C. N. Yang on his taste, tolerance, and pernsonality (a real *君子*).

*We are sun and moon, dear friend; we are sea and land. It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is: each the other's opposite and complement*

*The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool*
