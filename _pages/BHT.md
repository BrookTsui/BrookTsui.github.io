## Black Hole Thermodynamics and Negative Temperature

Our original argument is that if one considers the horizon radius $r$ as the position uncertainty of the singularity, there must be an energy uncertainty $\Delta E\sim \frac{1}{r}$, hence $E \Delta E\sim 1$ given $E\sim r$. One thus may consider the BH energy spectra as a band rather than a line. The appearance of the upper bound usually implies the possibility of negative temperature, hence the project. 

After studying BH physics and quantum mechanics, I realized it was wrong eventually. The point is that $r$ is actually the maximum position uncertainty, and then $\Delta E$ is the minimum uncertainty. The energy spectra are exactly the complement of the so-called band. No upper bound. 

But still, I decided to continue the research because I found it a fascinating thermodynamical concept. We generally believe that $\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}>0$ is true for BHs, but out of the pure formal symmetry, there is no reason to not discuss the opposite.

Firstly, I studied the regular negative temperature systems, including the population inversion in Laser and nuclear-spin systems. Their common feature, the symmetrical configuration of the highest energy and the lowest energy, led me to propose a general and simplified model for negative temperature. 

It is the energy-bounded and number-limited quantum S. H. O. For example, N oscillators huddling in $E=0$ state or $E=E_{max}$ state both have zero entropy, and then a smooth transition must yield a fraction with $\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}<0$. 


Quantifying the entropy requires the restricted integer partition function. I independently proved a recurrence relation. After communicating with a friend studying mathematics, I found it's a rather special case that has been studied previously. With his help, I learned a lot of number theory then and modified an equation from the [paper](../files/PN.pdf) which we adopted later on.

Then I began to connect it with BHs. During this period, I tried four ways: 

1. I followed the work of [Yuxiao Liu and Shaowen Wei](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.071103) on counting BH microstates via Ruppener geometry, discussing the entropy in the scheme of BH molecules. However, it is virtually irrelevant to our proposal and mainly restricted to the Van der Waals analogy. 
In this period, I came to the subject called BH phase transition and chaos. For interest, I discussed the phase space of RN-AdS BH, calculated the Lyapunov exponent by MMA, and studied the reaction of null and time-like geodesics of a point-like particle and classical string under the Large/Small BH phase transition. The free energies indeed undergo a discontinuous change. 

2. After the first attempt, I realized we should go beyond the static BHs since negative T systems are out of equilibrium, and then found [M. Park's paper](../files/parkexoticbtz.pdf) about the negative T appearing in exotic-BTZ black holes. I reproduced the result. But in the discussion with the mentor, we felt some arguments were skeptical. Therefore I did not follow the work. 

3. I considered the negative-entropy objects and white holes (WH), which seem promising for the subject. I independently proved that for WHs the temperature should be negative and entropy should be positive by considering WHs as the time-reversed BHs. However, I then found [Volovik](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10954) has published a series of papers for this project. Then it aborted. 

4. Meanwhile, I began to consider the possibility of mapping a negative T quantum system on the boundary to the bulk by AdS/CFT. It requires many mathematical and physical preliminaries, but the mentor and I both like it, so I bought many relevant books for preparation.

However, the pandemic began to rage. Quarantined at home without enough communication with the mentor, seeing the program as grim, and a terrible thing happened to inflict upon one of my dearest family members, I eventually decided to quit the group. 

Months later, I concluded all my work in a [report](../files/BH-T.pdf) and submitted it to the National Undergraduate Innovation Program and won the University Award. 

When logging this period, I came to the [paper](../files/jacobson-T.pdf) written by T. Jacobson *et al*  on the negative temperature, in which they considered the BHs in the casual diamonds with the appearance of upper energy bound. Another interesting possibility I never thought of before. 

In hindsight, I have learned a lot from this subject, which has led me into the palace of theoretical physics. I appreciate all of it in terms of this. However, this has also exposed my problems like being afraid to confer with the mentor, lacking the ability of information retrieving that I should find Volovik's or Jacobson's paper earlier, and giving up easily. 

Now, after a whole year, I believe I have overcome them. But still, hope this unsuccessful starting could be my toll ticking once I am on the verge of relapsing.
