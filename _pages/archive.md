# Miscellanous Thoughts 
1. GUP, generalized uncertainty principle. 

This is a short note about my idea on GUP. When I was scanning ArXiv, some related articles attracted my attention, and after searching I found the way people treat it is not satisfying, therefore I tried to give my solution. The result, however, still has some confusing traits like negative entropy, which although also appears in several GUP models. I do not publish it since I cannot give a consistent claim.
