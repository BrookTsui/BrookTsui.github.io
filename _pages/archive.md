This is my archive where one can find all my notes and haphazard writings. 

# Notes
## High Energy Theory 
1. [Black Hole Thermodynamics, Negative Temperature](../files/BH-T.pdf)

This is the PDF version (Chinese) of my report at the Physics Hall about black hole thermodynamics and negative temperature. 

A brief introduction to the topic covering the basic BH thermodynamics, the derivation of Hawking temperature, the discussion of negative temperature and exotic-BTZ black holes. 
 

2. String Theory and CFT

The string part covers mainly the front half of David Tong's lecture, and the CFT part comes from several sources. 

3. T-Duality

The final report of the class about string theory. 

4. Quantum Field Theory

I lavish to teach others since it also benefits me a lot. This note writen when I was teaching one of my roommate about QED, which he has to learn for quantum optics for the study of Ph.D.

5. [Majorana Fermions](../files/majorana.pdf)

The first time I came to it, I was fascinated by this interesting object, but I failed to understand its meaning then. Years later, when I began to study neutrino physics, it appears again and I tried to completely study it. 

6. Neutrino Mass 

I introduce basic electroweak theory, explain the zero-neutrino-mass requirement in SM, and discuss some some mass models.

# Report
1. [Hawking Emission](../files/hawkingppt.pdf)

This is the report I gave in the collaboration with Prof. Tsai of the University of Notre Dame. After doing research, I briefly discussed the curved-spacetime QFT, the calculation of the Hawking emission rate, and some perspectives on the subject.  

2. [PEPV](../files/pepv.pdf)

This is the report I made to the professors from Turkey on the ideas of my theoretical work in the PEPV. Some ideas were unclear then, and I developed them later on. The final form is in the paper.

# Miscellanous Thoughts 
1. [GUP, the Generalized Uncertainty Principle](../files/GUP.pdf)

This is a short note about my idea for GUP. When I was scanning ArXiv, some related articles attracted my attention, and after researching I found the way people treat it is not satisfying. Therefore I tried to give my solution. 

The result, however, still has some confusing traits like negative entropy, which also appears in several GUP models, and I thus have not published it since I failed to convence myself. 

In hindsight, the mentor's argument about the existence of negative temperature behavior in BH spacetime possibly originates from the GUP.
