# Notes
## High Energy Theory 
1. Black Hole Thermodynamics, Negtive temperature

This is the PDF version (Chinese) of my report at the Physics Hall about black hole thermodynamics and negative temperature. 

It is a brief introduction to the topic covering the derivation of Hawking temperature, the discussion of negative temperature and exotic-BTZ black holes. 
 

2. String Theory and CFT

Cover the front half of David Tong's lecture.

3. T-duality

4. Quantum Field Theory

5. Majorana fermions

# Miscellanous Thoughts 
1. GUP, the generalized uncertainty principle. 

This is a short note about my idea on GUP. When I was scanning ArXiv, some related articles attracted my attention, and after searching I found the way people treat it is not satisfying, therefore I tried to give my solution. 

The result, however, still has some confusing traits like negative entropy, which although also appears in several GUP models. 

I have not publish it since I cannot give a consistent claim.
