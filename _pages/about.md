My Chinese name is Horan Tsui or 崔浩然, but feel free to call me **Brook**, the English name I choose to remind me of being moderate. 
I also relish the pronunciation similar to 'book.'

## Here is my [CV](../files/Horan%20Tsui's%20CV.pdf)

I am an undergraduate student of Sichuan University (China) majoring Physics. I am interested in both HEP-theory and phenomenology, including extra-dimension physics (AdS/CFT, RS model, *etc*), dark matter, black hole, neutrino. I relish the deep and sometimes serendipitous convergence of them. 

Look up at the sky, a few birds flying across different disciplines of physics, seeing the various islands serendipitously converge at the end of the horizon. I wish I could be one of these free souls someday, straddling different fields, uncovering the unforeseeable unification. 

So I beat on.
