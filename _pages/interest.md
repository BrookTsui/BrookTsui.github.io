I have a broad interest across many fields, and enjoy the diversity and the serendipitous coalescence. 

Quote A. Zee"I am a field "
That I want to understand and possibly master the essence of important physics, and then devote myself into all fields I wonder why. 


## Neutrino Physics

It shocked me when knowing mass eigenstates are not necessarily interactive eigenstates. 

This results the massive neutrino oscillation, which has been observed by the SuperK and SNO, providing the first firm evidence of beyond the standard model.

Currently neutrino physics has vast experimental progress but still cannot address competely theoretical puzzles from the tiny neutrino masses:
1. why neutrino masses are far smaller than the proton mass and the electron mass?
2. Are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana-type fermion? 
3. Whether there are large CP violation in the neutrino sector? 
4. Can the neutrino provide successful baryogenesis mechanism, the leptogenesis, and how to test this mechanism? 
5. ...

These question can be answered by the low-energy experiments, such as neutrino-less double beta decay, neutrino long and short baseline, neutron-antineutron oscillation, etc. These experiments have relatively lower cost and would be one of the important directions in future. 



## Black Hole Thermodynamics
So far, I have read the notes like, and 

## AdS/CFT



## Quantum Field Thoery

There are many unknown and unsolved problems in QFT, 

AQFT

## Quantum Matter
The interest for this field originated from a lecture about the Black Hole/Superconductor correspondence given by S. Hartnor at Standford University. He mentioned that the 

Later on, I tried to read the note about Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) written by David Tong, 



## General Relativity



Highly recommend the book of S. Weinberg and the updating note of Blau. They are the best I ever seen. The first tells me what is the physics of GR, and the last tells everything about GR. 

Other than this, there are many good notes focusing on pariticular subjects, like E. Witten's note about the casual structure.
