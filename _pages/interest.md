I have a broad interest across many fields, and enjoy the diversity and the serendipitous coalescence. 

Want to understand and possibly master the essence of important physics, and then devote myself into all fields I wonder why. 


# Neutrino Physics

It shocked me when knowing mass eigenstates are not necessarily interactive eigenstates. This results the massive neutrino oscillation, which has been observed by the SuperK and SNO, providing the first firm evidence of beyond the standard model.

Currently neutrino physics has vast experimental progress but still cannot address competely theoretical puzzles from the tiny but non-zero neutrino masses:
1. What is the **origin of neutrino mass**? why is it so samll? 

2. Is it **Dirac or Majorana-type**? 

3. Whether there is a **large CP violation** in the neutrino sector? 
4. Can neutrinos provide a successful baryogenesis mechanism, and how to test it? 
5. ...

These question can be answered by the low-energy experiments, such as $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay, neutrino long and short baseline, neutron-antineutron oscillation, *etc*. The relatively lower costs means it would be one of the important directions in the future. 

Besides, the potential deviation of W-boson mass from SM also implies the incompleteness of the electroweak theory. 

From both theoretical and experimental aspects, neutrino physics is a subject not to be missed. Moreover, I secretly believe it is probably one of the rare subjects where **theories and experiments parade abreast** as of now.

# Quantum Field Thoery
As A. Zee said, QFT is not only a huge branch of physics but also a powerful tool and a universal perspective for almost everthing. By 

It is a mature subject that one can use a systematic way to operate 

There are many unknown and unsolved problems in QFT, which make it

Quote witten, we have yet to understand the quantum field theory. 

I have read an answer by Xiaogang Wen 

# Black Hole Thermodynamics & Gravity/Gauge Duality 
The pioneering work done by Bekenstein and Hawking has opened the vista to a brand new physical world, where quantum marries gravity. 

The ineffable area entropy implies the holography principle, the great revolution of our understanding of spacetime and information. This field has proved fruitful. 

The complexity proposed by L. Susskind 
and the recent progress made by A. Wall about the 

# Quantum Matter
The interest for this field originated from lectures about the [Black Hole/Superconductor correspondence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WY9xGPjS4&t=5054s) given by S. Hartnoll at Stanford University. Two points he mentioned impressed me: superconductor is as same as the U(1) symmetry-breaking mechine for photon; black holes, from AdS/CFT aspect, are nothing but quantum objects. 

I so far have three main interests abouut quantum matters: 

- Superconductor: 

The theory underlying the conventional superconductor is the BCS theory, which however can only explain the low-temperature superconductence. The room-temperature superconductors have transcended the paradigm. To understand it, we have to study the quantum liquids and other quantum exotic matters, like quark-gluon plasma and strongly correlated electron systems. A very useful and fruitful way of tackling these is the holographic duality, which is also coined as AdS/CMT for condensed matter physics. 

- AdS/CMT: 

In the opposite direction, CMT to AdS also provides us with useful models to study, like the SYK model and the Ising model. It is not irrelavent to mention that the most fanscinating part for me in the study of QHE is the connection with [gravity anomaly](../files/gravityanomaly.pdf). It is the merit of CMT. 

I have benefited a lot from likening the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) of electroweak theory to the Ising model inspired by the discussion of [Xiaogang Wen on PhysicsStackExchange.](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/29311/what-is-spontaneous-symmetry-breaking-in-quantum-systems)

Also, quantum matters are potential tools of [quantum simulation](../files/qshep.pdf) for high-energy physics. 

- Topological order: 

It thus reasonable to think the interplay of quantum matters with the prosperous AdS/CMT will play an important role in future physics, and some ideas of CMT, like topological order, *etc*, would benefit HEP in the same way as the SSB.  

For this field, I do not have a great ambition, and all I want is to savor its fanscinating progress, and then, if possible, bridge it with and injecting inspring elements into HEP. If lucky enough, vice versa. 

# Cosmology

*Quote Einstein: "I will not defend it (general relativity), and you will believe it once you study it. "*

What is your feeling when you know that the actual inertia guy is who freely falls instead of you standing readily on the earth? For me, a bolt of electrons raced up my spine. There are some beautiful structures within the classical GR, like marbles. HEP recently largely concentrates on quantum gravity, and the unavoidable singularities of GR become a stunning black blot. But other than this, I believe GR is intrinsically elegant.  

Except the beauty, it is also indispensable in the study of particle physics. That the discrepancies from the regular SM can be revealed by GR should not be mysterious since only by GR one can see the large-scale quantum world, whence dark matter and dark energy arise. 

It is thus a powerful way leading us to transcend SM. My interest in it can be divided into two classes: 

- **Dark Matter**. The very first firm ecidence is supposed by the exotic behavior of galaxies. 
Also, axions and dark photons are 


- **Dark Energy**. Also the extremely small [cosmological constant $\Lambda$](../files/Solacc.pdf) which is responsible for the observed expansion of the universe cannot be explained by any natural fine-tuning mechanisms of QFT. To account for it, we need to go beyond the current picture of physics, at least QFT. 

Besides, in the classical GR, the **geometry of spacetime** is a active field, a kind of old school physics that focuses on the spacetime structure and various quantities in curved spacetime, like the Penrose diagram and ADM mass. 

The recent salient fruit that [S. T. Yau and collaborators](../files/yau22.pdf) have proved the supertranslation-invariant definition of angular momentum in the curved spacetime, which was a long-nagging question in GR. The result will not only pave the way for further study of GR but also benefit gravitational wave detection since the emissions are usually produced by rotating emergence. 

We are not good intuitive thinkers of 4D (or higher) spacetime, there thus will be some counter-intuitive outcomes like the [negative temperature](../files/jacobson-T.pdf) appearing in the causal diamond, which is usually the best test for our understanding of the universe. 

BTW, highly recommend the book of [S. Weinberg](https://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Cosmology-Principles-Applications-Relativity/dp/0471925675/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=weinberg&qid=1664884399&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjIwIiwicXNhIjoiNC42NCIsInFzcCI6IjQuMzUifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-4) and the updating note of [M. Blau](http://www.blau.itp.unibe.ch/GRLecturenotes.html). They are the best I ever seen. The first tells me what is the physics of GR, and the last tells everything about GR.
