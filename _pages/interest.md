I have a broad interest across many fields, and enjoy the diversity and the serendipitous coalescence. 

Want to understand and possibly master the essence of important physics, and then devote myself into all fields I wonder why. 


## Neutrino Physics

It shocked me when knowing mass eigenstates are not necessarily interactive eigenstates. This results the massive neutrino oscillation, which has been observed by the SuperK and SNO, providing the first firm evidence of beyond the standard model.

Currently neutrino physics has vast experimental progress but still cannot address competely theoretical puzzles from the tiny neutrino masses:
1. What is the origin of neutrino mass? Is it Dirac or Majorana-type? 
2. why neutrino masses are far smaller than the proton mass and the electron mass?
3. Whether there is a large CP violation in the neutrino sector? 
4. Can neutrinos provide a successful baryogenesis mechanism, and how to test it? 
5. ...

These question can be answered by the low-energy experiments, such as $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay, neutrino long and short baseline, neutron-antineutron oscillation, *etc*. The relatively lower costs means it would be one of the important directions in the future. 

Besides, the potential deviation of W-boson mass from SM also implies the incompleteness of the electroweak theory. 

From both theoretical and experimental aspects, neutrino physics is a subject not to be missed. Moreover, I secretly believe it is probably one of the rare subjects where theories and experiments parade abreast as of now.

## Quantum Field Thoery

There are many unknown and unsolved problems in QFT,

Quote witten, we have yet to understand the quantum field theory. 

Paraphrase an interview of A. Zee: 
I like to classify myself as a quantum field theorist. It is the tool and language of particle physics and can be used to describe many things ... My entire academic life has focused on the universality of physics - many concepts can apply across disciplines. 

I have read an answer by Xiaogang Wen 

## Quantum Matter
The interest for this field originated from lectures about the [Black Hole/Superconductor correspondence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WY9xGPjS4&t=5054s) given by S. Hartnoll at Stanford University. Two points he mentioned impressed me: 
- Superconductor is as same as the U(1) symmetry-breaking mechine for photon 
- Black holes, from AdS/CFT aspect, are nothing but quantum objects

Later on, I tried to read the note about Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) written by David Tong, a

Topological order is another fanscinating part, in Wen's 



## Classical General Relativity & Cosmology

GR was once my favorite subject, and I secretly believed it must be the perfect theory, 

Dark Matter 
Highly recommend the book of S. Weinberg and the updating note of Blau. They are the best I ever seen. The first tells me what is the physics of GR, and the last tells everything about GR. 

Other than this, there are many good notes focusing on pariticular subjects, like E. Witten's note about the casual structure. 

Recently, S. T. Yau has proved the non-local angular momentum in the curved spacetime, and I found the classical GR, especially the very foucs on the Einstein equation as well as the differential geometry of spacetime are fanscinating. A kind of 'old school' physics.
