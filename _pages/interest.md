I have a broad interest across many fields, and enjoy the diversity and the serendipitous coalescence. 

Want to understand and possibly master the essence of important physics, and then devote myself into all fields I wonder why. 


# Neutrino Physics

It shocked me when knowing mass eigenstates are not necessarily interactive eigenstates. This results the massive neutrino oscillation, which has been observed by the SuperK and SNO, providing the first firm evidence of beyond the standard model.

Currently neutrino physics has vast experimental progress but still cannot address competely theoretical puzzles from the tiny but non-zero neutrino masses:
1. What is the **origin of neutrino mass**? why is it so samll? 

2. Is it **Dirac or Majorana-type**? 

3. Whether there is a **large CP violation** in the neutrino sector? 
4. Can neutrinos provide a successful baryogenesis mechanism, and how to test it? 
5. ...

These question can be answered by the low-energy experiments, such as $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay, neutrino long and short baseline, neutron-antineutron oscillation, *etc*. The relatively lower costs means it would be one of the important directions in the future. 

Besides, the potential deviation of W-boson mass from SM also implies the incompleteness of the electroweak theory. It is different from dark matters or dark energy, which are not necessarily beyond SM.

From both theoretical and experimental aspects, neutrino physics is a subject not to be missed. Moreover, I secretly believe it is probably one of the rare subjects where **theories and experiments parade abreast** as of now.

# Dark Matter

Except for the beauty, GR is also indispensable in the study of particle physics. That the discrepancies from the SM can be revealed by GR should not be mysterious since only by GR one can see the large-scale quantum world, whence arises the dark matter. 

Actually, the large scale structure of the universe comes from the dark matter otherwise the normal matters are too light to form the significant and complex clusters

It was firstly supported by the [difference in the observed mass distribution of galactic clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abell_1689) to the theoretical result. By approximation, it accounts for 85% of the total mass. A huge world is lurking.  

We have, so far, considered many possible dark matters, including dark photons, axions, sterile neutrinos, and PBHs, with a broad energy scale. They do not interact via SM gauge bosons but via some extra ones, leaving the tiny possibility of detection to possible portals. 

For the dark side, we are the dark side and the minority, which poorly consists of 15% of the total mass. How many would the coincidence of our world hold in a much large realm? Would the dark world rain? Are there planets and people in the dark world? Are they receiving the signals from us and trying to study our world which is also dark to them? For them consisting 85% of the total mass, is the detection or awareness to us harder for them? I ponder them in sonder. 

The dark section is not the world huddling in a corner of the universe but scattering miscellaneously around us. Thanks to the common environment shared, we can suppose they obey the same fundamental rules like symmetry, which leads us to go beyond the SM but not necessarily the QFT, GR, and whatnot.    

Surely, we might need some new fundamental rules for studying the dark section. It is an answer awaiting the right questions. 

# Quantum Entanglement

The Quantum Entanglement was initiated by [the EPR paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox), developed ably by many others, and now has increasingly become an important branch that seems able to unify many disciplines.  

My interest is in its correlation with the following: 

- AdS/CFT

There are many fascinating fruits of AdS/CFT, I however here wish to emphasize one the most salient (in my opinion), the RT-formula, which states that the entanglement entropy of the boundary system is as same as the area entropy of the corresponding minimum-area volume. An implication would be that there will be no volume when there is no entanglement on the boundary. Somehow, gravity emerges from quantum. 

The Hawking radiation itself has many clues to the entanglement, given the recent progress made by A.Wall and N. Engelhardtarea. 

Bell inequility and CHSH inequility can apply to BHs, giving the most precise description of firewall 
I think AdS/CFT endows us with a unique perspective on the role of entanglement in fundamental physics. 

- QFT

There is [an answer](https://www.zhihu.com/question/455033981/answer/2638229491) written Xiaogang Wen about the necessity of the 'gauge.' And the quick takeaway: it may result from the long-range entanglement property of QFT. 

The entanglement is not only a fancy story that can be discussed under QFT but also enacts an indispensable role in its structure, like the ineffable gemstone, [the Reeh-Schlieder theorem](../files/wittenqft.pdf) that one can in principle create any states far away by local states, revealing the intrinsic entanglement component of QFT. 

A better understanding of the entanglement would benefit the axiomatization of QFT, including AQFT, and the physics of beyond SM since it does not necessarily mean beyond the quantum field theory, which, being a frame, applies throughout the discussion of dark matters and neutrinos *, etc*.

The 2022 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for quantum information. The golden age for QI is coming. To where the entanglement will lead us? 

# Black Hole

What is your feeling when you know that the actual inertia guy is who freely falls instead of you standing readily on the earth? For me, a bolt of electrons raced up my spine. There are some beautiful structures within the classical GR, like marbles. HEP recently largely concentrates on quantum gravity, and the unavoidable singularities of GR become a stunning black blot. But other than this, I believe GR is intrinsically elegant. 
The pioneering work done by Bekenstein and Hawking has opened the vista to a brand new physical world, where quantum marries gravity. 

The ineffable area entropy implies the holography principle, the great revolution of our understanding of spacetime and information. This field has proved fruitful. 

Every quantum gravity theory should pass the exam from black holes. This is a not-to-miss track toward the great phyiscs. 

To better understand the BHs, we should also understand the GR, or the geometery of spacetime better. 

Besides, in the classical GR, the **geometry of spacetime** is an active field, a kind of old school physics that focuses on the spacetime structure and various quantities in curved spacetime, like the Penrose diagram and ADM mass. 

The recent salient fruit that [S. T. Yau and collaborators](../files/yau22.pdf) have proved the supertranslation-invariant definition of angular momentum in the curved spacetime, which was a long-nagging question in GR. The result will not only pave the way for further study of GR but also benefit gravitational wave detection since the emissions are usually produced by rotating emergence. 

We are not good intuitive thinkers of 4D (or higher) spacetime, there thus will be some counter-intuitive outcomes like the [negative temperature](../files/jacobson-T.pdf) appearing in the causal diamond, which is usually the best test for our understanding of the universe. 

- **Dark Energy**. Also the extremely small [cosmological constant $\Lambda$](../files/Solacc.pdf) which is responsible for the observed expansion of the universe cannot be explained by any natural fine-tuning mechanisms of QFT. To account for it, we need to go beyond the current picture of physics, at least QFT. 

BTW, highly recommend the book of [S. Weinberg](https://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Cosmology-Principles-Applications-Relativity/dp/0471925675/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=weinberg&qid=1664884399&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjIwIiwicXNhIjoiNC42NCIsInFzcCI6IjQuMzUifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-4) and the updating note of [M. Blau](http://www.blau.itp.unibe.ch/GRLecturenotes.html). They are the best I ever seen. The first tells me what is the physics of GR, and the last tells everything about GR.

# Quantum Matter
The interest for this field originated from lectures about the [Black Hole/Superconductor correspondence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5WY9xGPjS4&t=5054s) given by S. Hartnoll at Stanford University. Two points he mentioned impressed me: superconductor is as same as the U(1) symmetry-breaking mechine for photon; black holes, from AdS/CFT aspect, are nothing but quantum objects. 

I so far have three main interests abouut quantum matters: 

- Superconductor: 

The theory underlying the conventional superconductor is the BCS theory, which however can only explain the low-temperature superconductence. The room-temperature superconductors have transcended the paradigm. To understand it, we have to study the quantum liquids and other quantum exotic matters, like quark-gluon plasma and strongly correlated electron systems. A very useful and fruitful way of tackling these is the holographic duality, which is also coined as AdS/CMT for condensed matter physics. 

- AdS/CMT: 

In the opposite direction, CMT to AdS also provides us with useful models to study, like the SYK model and the Ising model. It is not irrelavent to mention that the most fanscinating part for me in the study of QHE is the connection with [gravity anomaly](../files/gravityanomaly.pdf). It is the merit of CMT. 

I have benefited a lot from likening the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) of electroweak theory to the Ising model inspired by the discussion of [Xiaogang Wen on PhysicsStackExchange.](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/29311/what-is-spontaneous-symmetry-breaking-in-quantum-systems)

Also, quantum matters are potential tools of [quantum simulation](../files/qshep.pdf) for high-energy physics. 

It thus reasonable to think the interplay of quantum matters with the prosperous AdS/CMT will play an important role in future physics, and some ideas of CMT, like topological order, *etc*, would benefit HEP in the same way as the SSB.  

For this field, I do not have a great ambition, and all I want is to savor its fanscinating progress, and then, if possible, bridge it with and injecting inspring elements into HEP. If lucky enough, vice versa.
